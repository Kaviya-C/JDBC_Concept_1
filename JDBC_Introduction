Java DataBase Connectivity JDBC

Here am go through how the data from front end will fetch to the DataBase

There are 6 steps to follows:

step:1
import the package---> 
          import java.sql package;
          
step:2
Load and register the mysql driver in eclipse
Load----> com.mysql.cj.jdbc.driver
Register---->  Class.forName(com.mysql.cj.jdbc.driver)


Step:3
Establish the connection 
Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection()


Step:4
Create the statement  -->normal statement
                      -->prepared statement

                      --> callable statement

step:5
executet the query


Step:6
all this process give some response to us that is result


Step:7
close


// How can be implement this steps in java program:

1----------------->

import java.sql.*;


2------------------>
right click on the project go to properties then click java build path ----> click classpath  --> then Add Library   ----> now select the mysql connector which is downloaded in the internet ----> apply and close

public static void main(String...args)
{

     first have to register the mysql driver
     the driver name is com.mysql.cj.jdbc.driver  

     load above driver with the help of forName()
     method.forName() is a method which wil load the driver


     this forName() method belongs to class called as  Class

    3------------------->
     Class.forName('com.mysql.cj.jdbc.driver');
     establish the collection
     Connection is an interface ---> we are not able to create an object for interface


     so we are not able to perform the 
     Connection con=new Connection() ---> this is not applicable for interface 

     so we have to find out the method which will give
     me the object of connection..

     someone has implemented the interface connection 
     that method is:
     
     getConnection()  this is a method which wil give the object of a connection
     getConnection() takes 3 parameter as an arguments
     first: URL
     second: Username
     third:Password
     getConnection is a static method which is there in DriverManager class

     4----------------------->
     Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection('url','kaviya','root');

     //create an statement

     Statement is an interface 
     Statement stmt= con.createStatement();


         //execute
       5----------->
       Resultset is an interface that holds this query
       Resultset res = stmt.executeQuery('Select * from student');
       // it holds the table


       in student table have name and roll no of 3 students


      6----------------->
       // next() check the student having next student is available are there??
       while(res.next()){
        System.out.println(res.getInt()+' '+res.getString());
       }


       7----------------->
       stmt.close();
       con.close(); 

}
