There are 4 types of drivers are there:


JDBC-ODBC- bridge driver

Native-API driver

Network protocol driver

driver or thin driver


whenever registering the driver : 
it throws some exception that must be throws in the sqlexception bcoz of getConnection() method
 and classnotfoundexception bcoz of forName

Class.forName('com.mysql.cj.jdbc.driver');

establish the connection create one database inside create table

here we have to give the url username and password

url ------> jdbc.mysql://localhost:3306/databasee name

now we usee the query as select * from student 
for this query we have to use the 

method called executeQuery(write the query here)   

then  store that in the resultset interface

next() point out the record of the next student 

this will makes tha we have to fetch the details of the student from the database 

DDL --> Data Definition Language
Changing the structure of ur database

DML----->Data Manipulation Language
change the value of the database
eg: executeUpdate int return how many rows affected
if u want to insert the record then use this method


DQL----->Data Query language  
fetching data 
executeQuery() to get the details from the database


preparedStatement --->changing the values frequently use preparedStatement here

int userid=9;
String userName="john";

PreparedStatement pre = con.prepareStatement(query);
insert into student values ?,?;

pre.setInt(1,userId);
pre.setString(2.username);

int count = pre.executeUpdate();

System.out.println(count);
